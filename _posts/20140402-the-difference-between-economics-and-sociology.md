# The difference between economics and sociology

Pollak (Review of Economics of the Household, 2003) 

> The interpretation of behaviors such as childbearing, marriage and divorce as active choices by maximizing agents rather than as passive responses to social or cultural forces epitomizes the economic approach. James S. Duesenberry(1960), in a comment on Becker's classic 1960 fertility paper, summarized this threshold issue neatly when he wrote: ''I used to tell my students that the difference between economics and sociology is very simple. Economics is all about how people make choices. Sociology is all about why they don't have any choices to make''(p.233).
