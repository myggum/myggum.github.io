## Hi, there!

I am a graduate student studying economics.  
I am interested in many things: economy, ecnomics, society, people, politics, computer, programming, internet, etc..
and I am going to post about these things.

## This is..
an experimental blog using [Github](http://github.com) page, powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). 
I am using [Hyde](http://mdo.github.io/hyde) theme with very minor modification. Those are excellent and super easy to use.
If you are interested in running your own blog, I strongly encourge you to consider them.


Thank you for reading this. Enjoy!
